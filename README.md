Android Application for Karachi's Public Transport

Karachi is the biggest city and financial hub of Pakistan whose population is about 14,500,000 citizens and more than 2 million people of this city commute through public transport on daily bases. There exists a vast majority of these commuters who have obscure information about public transport and their routes which led them to misguidance and wastage of time on bus stops. According to the research an average commuter waste around 20 minutes per day waiting at bus stop which is around wasting 10 days per year.

The project is develop to resolve these issues and provide a convenient platform to the commuters so that they can easily access public transport information like bus routes along with other cost-effective travel options like cab service, taxis and rickshaw. The application will let them know about the fares for the selected ride option and approximated average time to reach the destination. We also resovlve the issue for those commuters who donâ€™t have an android phone or access to internet by providing the SMS service so that our application will empower commuters and enhance the reach of urban transport. Transport is the backbone behind the largest GDP generating city Karachi, so the problems faced by 2 million of its commuters need to be addressed. Transit will play a vital role in minimizing the problems related to Karachi transport.
